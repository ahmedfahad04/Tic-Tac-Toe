# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This is a very simple implementation of 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. In general we play this game in 2 categories

* Human Vs Human
* Computer Vs Human

As far now I have implemented both of these categories in between two cpp files names **singleUser.cpp** and 
**doubleUser.cpp**. In later version we'll sum of those files into a single one for better implementation. 

## Instruction

The instruction is pretty simple. The tic-tac-toe board is similar to the **Numpad Keys**. Press corresponding button to fill out respective cells.

## Language 
It's very simple and short project. Nothing complex concepts like data structures or algorithm hasn't used. **C++** is used to demstrate the game's concept. In future version, the UI will be developed using **Java** and **JavaFx**. 

## Project Outcome
Your query to why I made that simple projct marks the answer below: 

* Understanding how to implement any idea into code
* How to write a function oriented program to demonstrate a
complete idea
* How logic works and how to implement logics in codes.
